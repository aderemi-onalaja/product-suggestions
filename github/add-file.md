# Product Suggestion: Easier "Add File" in New Repositories

- **Suggestion**  
Add a clear, prominent “+ Add New File” button in the Quick Setup section when a new repository is created.  

- **Why**  
Currently, after creating a new repository, the “create new file” option is small and easy to miss. A more visible button would help first-time users start adding files quickly without needing to search through menus or scroll down.
